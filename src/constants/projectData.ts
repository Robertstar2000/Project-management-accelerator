The project follows a 9-phase methodology (HMAP). You must assign each document to the most appropriate phase. The phases are:
1.  **Develop Concept Proposal**: Define scope, vision, and high-level objectives.
2.  **List Resources & Skills Needed**: Inventory of roles, skills, external partners, and tooling.
3.  **SWOT Analysis & Support Gathering**: Analyze risks, strengths, weaknesses; secure stakeholder buy-in.
4.  **Kickoff Review & Briefing**: Align team, confirm objectives, and set expectations.
5.  **Initial Planning & Statement of Work (SOW)**: Detail boundaries, deliverables, and constraints.
6.  **Preliminary Design Review**: Formal review of the SOW and initial plans.
7.  **Develop Detailed Plans & Timeline**: Create WBS, task lists, and milestones.
8.  **Sprint & Critical Design Planning**: Define sprint-level requirements and conduct final design review.
9.  **Deployment Review & Execution Start**: Final readiness check before starting work.

CRITICAL: You MUST include the following seven core HMAP documents, assigned to their correct phases as specified below:
- "Concept Proposal" (must be in phase 1)
- "Resources & Skills List" (must be in phase 2)
- "SWOT Analysis" (must be in phase 3)
- "Kickoff Briefing" (must be in phase 4)
- "Statement of Work (SOW)" (must be in phase 5)
- "Detailed Plans (WBS/WRS)" (must be in phase 7)
- "Project Timeline" (must be in phase 7)

In addition to these seven, add more documents that are highly specific and standard for the "${discipline}" discipline to meet the total count of ${docCount}.

Your final output must be a single, raw JSON object, without any surrounding text or markdown formatting. This JSON object must have a single root key named "documents" containing an array of document objects. Each document object must have exactly two keys: "title" (string) and "phase" (number).

Generate a Change Deployment Plan. You must use professional, industry-standard terminology specific to the '${discipline}' field throughout the plan. Use the following strict Markdown format. Do not include any other text, explanations, or introductory sentences.

## Impact Analysis
- **Estimated Delay:** [Provide a quantitative estimate, e.g., 5-7 business days]
- **Disruption Impact:** [Describe the potential disruption to the team or ongoing work, e.g., High - requires pausing Sprint 2 tasks]

## Affected Documents
[A bulleted list of document titles that require manual updates based on this change.]

## Task Modifications
[A list of task changes. Each line must start with 'ADD:', 'DELETE:', or 'EDIT:'. For 'ADD' and 'EDIT', provide task details in parentheses like this: (Start: YYYY-MM-DD, End: YYYY-MM-DD, Sprint: Sprint Name, Depends On: Task Name). For 'DELETE', just list the task name.]

The project follows a 9-phase methodology (HMAP). You must assign each document to the most appropriate phase. The phases are:
1.  **Develop Concept Proposal**: Define scope, vision, and high-level objectives.
2.  **List Resources & Skills Needed**: Inventory of roles, skills, external partners, and tooling.
3.  **SWOT Analysis & Support Gathering**: Analyze risks, strengths, weaknesses; secure stakeholder buy-in.
4.  **Kickoff Review & Briefing**: Align team, confirm objectives, and set expectations.
5.  **Initial Planning & Statement of Work (SOW)**: Detail boundaries, deliverables, and constraints.
6.  **Preliminary Design Review**: Formal review of the SOW and initial plans.
7.  **Develop Detailed Plans & Timeline**: Create WBS, task lists, and milestones.
8.  **Sprint & Critical Design Planning**: Define sprint-level requirements and conduct final design review.
9.  **Deployment Review & Execution Start**: Final readiness check before starting work.

CRITICAL: You MUST include the following seven core HMAP documents, assigned to their correct phases as specified below:
- "Concept Proposal" (must be in phase 1)
- "Resources & Skills List" (must be in phase 2)
- "SWOT Analysis" (must be in phase 3)
- "Kickoff Briefing" (must be in phase 4)
- "Statement of Work (SOW)" (must be in phase 5)
- "Detailed Plans (WBS/WRS)" (must be in phase 7)
- "Project Timeline" (must be in phase 7)

In addition to these seven, add more documents that are highly specific and standard for the "${discipline}" discipline to meet the total count of ${docCount}. For example, for "Software Development", you might add "Technical Design Specification" and "User Story Backlog". For "Construction", you might add "Permit Applications" and "Bill of Materials". Use your expert knowledge of the discipline to select the most appropriate documents.

Your final output must be a single, raw JSON object, without any surrounding text or markdown formatting. This JSON object must have a single root key named "documents" containing an array of document objects. Each document object must have exactly two keys: "title" (string) and "phase" (number).

Generate a Change Deployment Plan. You must use professional, industry-standard terminology specific to the '${discipline}' field throughout the plan. Use the following strict Markdown format. Do not include any other text, explanations, or introductory sentences.

## Impact Analysis
- **Estimated Delay:** [Provide a quantitative estimate, e.g., 5-7 business days]
- **Disruption Impact:** [Describe the potential disruption to the team or ongoing work, e.g., High - requires pausing Sprint 2 tasks]

## Affected Documents
[A bulleted list of document titles that require manual updates based on this change.]

## Task Modifications
[A list of task changes. Each line must start with 'ADD:', 'DELETE:', or 'EDIT:'. For 'ADD' and 'EDIT', provide task details in parentheses like this: (Start: YYYY-MM-DD, End: YYYY-MM-DD, Sprint: Sprint Name, Depends On: Task Name). For 'DELETE', just list the task name.]

You are an expert project risk analyst with deep experience in the "${projectDataSummary.discipline}" field. Your task is to analyze the provided project data and identify the top 3 most critical risks to the project's success.

First, review the context from the key planning documents to understand the project's original intent and scope.

Based on your analysis of both the plan and the current state, generate a concise risk report. Your response MUST use the following Markdown format. Do not include any introductory or concluding text.

### 1. [Risk Title 1]
- **Impact:** [Describe the potential negative outcome if this risk is realized. Be specific, e.g., "High - Could cause a 2-week slip in the final delivery date and a $10,000 budget overrun."]
- **Mitigation:** [Suggest a concrete, actionable strategy to reduce the likelihood or impact of this risk. e.g., "Immediately assign a dedicated QA resource to the 'Integration Testing' task and schedule daily check-ins."]

### 2. [Risk Title 2]
- **Impact:** [Description]
- **Mitigation:** [Suggestion]

### 3. [Risk Title 3]
- **Impact:** [Description]
- **Mitigation:** [Suggestion]

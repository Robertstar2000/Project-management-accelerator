        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sign Up & Start:</strong> Create your account and start your first project in seconds. The 'My Work' dashboard shows all tasks assigned to you across all projects, keeping you focused.</li>
            <li><strong>Define Your Project:</strong> Use the guided form to define your project's scope, discipline, and complexity. Choose from a professional template or have the AI generate a custom document list tailored to your needs.</li>
            <li><strong>Generate Your Plan with AI:</strong> Work through the HMAP phases. In Phase 1, provide your high-level goals. The AI will generate a detailed Concept Proposal, then use that context to draft every subsequent document, ensuring a cohesive plan from start to finish.</li>
            <li><strong>Execute with Clarity:</strong> Once your plan is approved, the AI automatically populates a full suite of tracking tools. Manage tasks on a Gantt chart or Kanban board, collaborate with your team via comments and attachments, and monitor team capacity with the Workload view.</li>
            <li><strong>Monitor & Adapt:</strong> The main Dashboard gives you a real-time overview of project health, risks, and financials. When changes happen, use the Revision Control tool to model their impact on your budget and timeline *before* you commit.</li>
            <li><strong>Gain AI Insights:</strong> Leverage powerful AI actions on your dashboard. Generate executive-level summaries for stakeholders or perform a deep risk analysis of your project's current state with a single click.</li>
        </ul>
